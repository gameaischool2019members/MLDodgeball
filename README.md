You are the red ball, and the scope of the game is to avoid being hit by the giant soccerballs for as long as possible.
If you're hit the game starts again from the initial state.
The blue boxes are ML-agents that have been trained to seek out and kick the soccerballs. They will also seek you out and bounce you off, making your life harder.

Our team's goal was to learn about Machine Learning in Unity.
